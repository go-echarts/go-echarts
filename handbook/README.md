# üî∞ Installation

Classic way to get go-echarts

```shell
# this may be a stupid way to use v2 go-echarts without gomod(GO111MODULE=off) because of
# the next generation version management system... üê∂
# if you get a better workaround, please let me know....

$ go get -u github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts/...
$ cd $go-echarts-project
$ mkdir v2 && mv charts components datasets opts render templates types v2
```

Use gomod style

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts/v2/...
```

OR

```shell
# go.mod

require github.com/go-echarts/go-echarts/v2
```

# ‚è≥ Version Control

The go-echarts project is being developed under v2 version and the active codebase is on the master branch.

v1 and v2 are incompatible which means that you cannot upgrade go-echarts from v1 to v2 smoothly. But I think it is
worth trying that new version.

Especially, when there contains mino changes (usually in enhancement), we will release the `rc` version before a
standard
release.
So, if you upgrade your projects cross the `rc` versions, maybe
need little adjust.

# ‚ú® Features
